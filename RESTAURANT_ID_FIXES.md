# Restaurant ID Parameter Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Page-level Query Parameter Handling
**Problem**: Most pages (analytics, reports, tables, staff, dashboard) didn't handle the `restaurant` query parameter from URL.

**Fixed Files**:
- ✅ `/app/analytics/page.tsx` - Now handles `searchParams.restaurant` with proper access validation
- ✅ `/app/reports/page.tsx` - Now handles `searchParams.restaurant` with proper access validation  
- ✅ `/app/tables/page.tsx` - Now handles `searchParams.restaurant` with proper access validation
- ✅ `/app/staff/page.tsx` - Now handles `searchParams.restaurant` with proper access validation
- ✅ `/app/page.tsx` - Main dashboard now handles `searchParams.restaurant` with proper access validation
- ✅ `/app/orders/page.tsx` - Already had correct implementation

**Logic Implemented**:
- For `org_admin`: Can access any restaurant in their organization via query param
- For `super_admin`: Can access any restaurant via query param  
- For regular staff: Can only access their assigned restaurant (rejects unauthorized restaurant access)
- Proper fallback to first restaurant in organization for org_admin
- Proper fallback to assigned restaurant for regular staff

### 2. API Parameter Consistency
**Problem**: APIs expected `restaurantId` parameter, which was correctly used.

**Status**: ✅ **Already Consistent**
- All API routes use `restaurantId` parameter
- All component API calls use `restaurantId` parameter
- No changes needed

### 3. Navigation Links Consistency  
**Problem**: Navigation links in restaurant details use `restaurant=${restaurant.id}` format.

**Status**: ✅ **Already Correct**
- `components/restaurant-details.tsx` correctly uses `restaurant=${restaurant.id}` for navigation
- Pages correctly expect `searchParams.restaurant` parameter
- No changes needed

### 4. Dashboard API Enhancement
**Fixed Files**:
- ✅ `/app/api/dashboard/metrics/route.ts` - Now accepts optional `restaurantId` parameter
- ✅ `/components/dashboard-stats.tsx` - Now accepts and passes `restaurantId` parameter
- ✅ `/app/page.tsx` - Now passes restaurant ID to dashboard component

**Enhancement**: Dashboard API now supports both:
- No parameter: Uses role-based restaurant access (all org restaurants for org_admin, assigned restaurant for staff)
- With `restaurantId`: Uses specific restaurant with proper access validation

## Access Control Matrix

| User Role | Query Parameter Access | Fallback Behavior |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| `super_admin` | Any restaurant | First restaurant in system |
| `org_admin` | Restaurants in their organization only | First restaurant in their organization |
| `manager`, `server`, `kitchen`, `cashier` | Only their assigned restaurant | Their assigned restaurant |

## Files Updated

### Page Components (5 files)
1. `/app/analytics/page.tsx` - Added query parameter handling
2. `/app/reports/page.tsx` - Added query parameter handling  
3. `/app/tables/page.tsx` - Added query parameter handling
4. `/app/staff/page.tsx` - Added query parameter handling
5. `/app/page.tsx` - Added query parameter handling and restaurant ID passing

### API Routes (1 file)
1. `/app/api/dashboard/metrics/route.ts` - Added optional restaurantId parameter with validation

### Components (1 file)
1. `/components/dashboard-stats.tsx` - Added restaurantId prop support

### Database Schema Fixes (1 file)
1. `/app/api/dashboard/metrics/route.ts` - Fixed column names (`total_amount` vs `total`, `staff` table vs `users`)

## Navigation Flow Examples

### Org Admin Flow
1. Org admin goes to `/restaurants` (restaurant management page)
2. Clicks on "View Analytics" for Restaurant A → `/analytics?restaurant=restaurant-a-id`
3. Analytics page validates org admin has access to restaurant A
4. Analytics page loads data for restaurant A specifically
5. Analytics component calls API with `restaurantId=restaurant-a-id`

### Regular Staff Flow  
1. Staff member navigates to `/analytics?restaurant=some-other-restaurant-id`
2. Page validates staff member doesn't have access to `some-other-restaurant-id`
3. Page redirects to unauthorized access error OR shows their assigned restaurant instead
4. Analytics loads for their assigned restaurant only

## Remaining Implementation Gaps (None Found)

After comprehensive sweep, all restaurant ID parameter handling has been standardized:

✅ **Query Parameter Flow**: `restaurant=<id>` in URL → `searchParams.restaurant` in page → validation → component props
✅ **API Parameter Flow**: `restaurantId=<id>` in API calls → proper validation in API routes  
✅ **Access Control**: Proper role-based validation for all restaurant access
✅ **Database Schema**: Correct column names and table references
✅ **Build Success**: No TypeScript compilation errors

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:
1. **Org Admin Navigation**:
   - [ ] From restaurant list → Analytics (should load correct restaurant)
   - [ ] From restaurant list → Reports (should load correct restaurant)  
   - [ ] From restaurant list → Orders (should load correct restaurant)
   - [ ] From restaurant list → Tables (should load correct restaurant)
   - [ ] From restaurant list → Staff (should load correct restaurant)

2. **URL Direct Access**:
   - [ ] `/analytics?restaurant=valid-restaurant-id` (should work for authorized users)
   - [ ] `/analytics?restaurant=unauthorized-restaurant-id` (should deny/fallback)
   - [ ] `/reports?restaurant=valid-restaurant-id` (should work for authorized users)

3. **Dashboard Metrics**:
   - [ ] Main dashboard shows correct restaurant data
   - [ ] Dashboard with `?restaurant=<id>` shows specific restaurant data
   - [ ] API returns real data (not dummy data)

4. **Staff Access Control**:
   - [ ] Regular staff cannot access other restaurants via query params
   - [ ] Org admin can access all restaurants in their organization
   - [ ] Super admin can access any restaurant

All major restaurant ID parameter inconsistencies have been identified and fixed. The system now has proper query parameter handling with role-based access control throughout.
