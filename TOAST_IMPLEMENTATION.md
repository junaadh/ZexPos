### Sonner Configuration
```tsx
// In /app/layout.tsx
import { Toaster } from "sonner"

<Toaster position="top-right" />
```

### Usage Pattern
```tsx
// Import in components
import { toast } from "sonner"

// Success notifications
toast.success("Operation completed successfully")

// Error notifications  
toast.error("Operation failed: [reason]")

// With specific error messages
toast.error(`Failed to update: ${error.message}`)
```

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**
